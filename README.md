📌 Task 3 – Text Generation with Markov Chains

This project is part of my PRODIGY Generative AI Internship.
The goal was to build a simple text generator using Markov Chains – a statistical model that predicts the next word in a sequence based on the previous ones.

🚀 How it Works

The program learns from a given text (training data).
It builds a dictionary of possible next words for each word/phrase.
It then generates new sentences by randomly choosing the next word from those probabilities.
You can control how many words are generated and how much "context" is used (unigram, bigram, trigram).

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python (standard libraries only)
Random module for probability-based word selection
